# Description:
#      The Perceptron is a linear binary classifier that assigns an input vector to one of two classes based on a learned decision boundary.
#      The decision boundary is given by d(x) = w * x + w_0 = 0
#      where:
#          w => Weight vector(Found in training)
#          x => Input Vector(Given data)
#          w_0 => Bias term
